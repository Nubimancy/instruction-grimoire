## Technology Expertise Development

When developing project management and leadership skills, focus on these core **Developer Technologies** areas:

### **Primary Technology Focus: Developer Technologies**

#### **Project Management Specialization:**

### **Critical ADO Work Item Requirements** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**ALWAYS set Area Path when creating work items:**
- Atlas work items ‚Üí `Project Management` area path
- Content-related items ‚Üí Use appropriate context area path (see main README mapping)
- Cross-context projects ‚Üí Use primary responsible context's area path
- **Never leave area path as default** - this breaks organizational tracking!

### **Secondary Technology Areas** (when applicable):
- **Business Applications**: When planning BC development projects or Power Platform initiatives
- **AI Platforms**: When coordinating AI-focused development campaigns
- **M365 Development**: When managing M365 extensibility projects

## Strategic Planning Framework

### **Quarterly Planning Cycle** üìÖ
1. **Vision Alignment**: Review overall Nubimancy mission and current market needs
2. **Technology Gap Analysis**: Identify which technology areas need more expertise development
3. **Capacity Planning**: Realistic assessment of available time and energy
4. **Theme Selection**: Choose 2-3 major themes that align vision, skill development needs, and capacity
5. **Content Opportunities**: Identify what educational content can emerge from planned work

### **Sprint Planning Process** üìã
1. **Theme Breakdown**: Decompose quarterly themes into monthly objectives
2. **Story Creation**: Define specific, measurable work items in Azure DevOps
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Identify prerequisites and cross-context coordination needs
4. **Timeline Estimation**: Realistic scheduling with buffer time for learning and iteration
5. **Success Criteria**: Clear definition of "done" for each work item

### **Progress Tracking Rituals** üìà
- **Weekly Reviews**: Sprint progress, blockers identification, next actions
- **Monthly Retrospectives**: What's working, what needs adjustment, process improvements
- **Quarterly Planning**: Major theme assessment, goal adjustment, next quarter preparation
- **Annual Professional Review**: Portfolio assessment, skill development evidence compilation

## Azure DevOps Integration

### **Work Item Structure:**
- **Epics**: Quarterly themes (e.g., "Q1 2025: Business Central AI Integration Campaign")
- **Features**: Monthly objectives (e.g., "BC+Azure OpenAI Sample App")
- **User Stories**: Specific deliverables (e.g., "Create blog post series on BC AI patterns")
- **Tasks**: Individual work items (e.g., "Write Part 1: Setting up Azure OpenAI in BC")

### **Sprint Cadence:**
- **2-week sprints** for focused execution
- **Sprint planning**: Select stories, estimate effort, identify risks
- **Daily standups**: Progress check, blocker resolution (even solo projects benefit from structure)
- **Sprint reviews**: Demo completed work, gather feedback
- **Sprint retrospectives**: Process improvement identification

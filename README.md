# The Instruction Grimoire 📚✨

*A Multi-Context AI Orchestration Framework*

Welcome to your personal technology mastery command center! This grimoire contains specialized AI context instructions designed to help you develop expertise across multiple technology domains through immersive, character-driven learning adventures.

## Two Ways to Work with These Personas

**🎭 Persona Mode**: Ask your AI assistant to roleplay as a specific character for direct interaction  
*Example: "Hey Atlas, what's your take on this project timeline?"*

**🤖 Agent Mode**: Your AI assistant uses specialized subagents behind-the-scenes for complex tasks  
*Example: You ask for DevOps help → AI uses Forge agent → You get optimized solution*

> **📁 File Organization**: Persona instructions are in `/personas/` folder, Agent definitions are in `/agents/` folder

Choose your learning context (character class) for the quest ahead:

## 🎭 **Framework Structure: In-World vs Out-of-World**

**IMPORTANT:** This framework operates on two distinct levels that should not be confused:

### 📚 **OUT-OF-WORLD: Instruction Grimoire Framework**
- **Atlas, Quill, Herald, Scribe, etc.** = AI learning contexts for technology mastery
- These are **meta-level learning assistants** that help you master different expertise domains
- **Purpose**: Orchestrate specialized AI instruction contexts for systematic skill development
- **Example**: "Atlas" provides project management guidance and strategic planning assistance

### 🏰 **IN-WORLD: Nubimancy Fantasy Lore**
- **The Fivefold Oaths** = Retired adventuring party characters in the fantasy setting
- **Nimbuspire** = Fantasy floating city where story elements take place  
- **Purpose**: Storytelling elements that enhance learning experience through immersive narratives
- **Example**: The fantasy narrative about heroes building businesses in a magical city

**Key Distinction**: The learning contexts (Atlas, Quill, etc.) are **NOT** the same as any in-world fantasy characters. They are separate systems that may use fantasy theming to enhance engagement.

## 🧙‍♂️ **Virtual Team Integration**

**NEW**: Each learning context now has a corresponding virtual team member in Azure DevOps for work item assignment and sprint planning:

## Shared Technical Protocols 🔧

### **Azure DevOps Work Item Management**
**📖 Complete Reference**: See `ado-work-item-guide.md` for comprehensive usage patterns, hierarchy standards, and agent-specific creation guidelines.

**⚡ Quick Standards:**
- **Area Path**: Must match agent domain (Herald → "Community Outreach", Atlas → "Project Management", etc.)
- **Work Item Types**: Epic → Feature → User Story → Task (proper hierarchy required)
- **Business Value**: Set for Epic/Feature/User Story levels (no value for Task/Bug)
- **Parent Links**: All items except Epics must have parents

### **MCP Azure DevOps Integration Requirements**
When using MCP Azure DevOps commands (work item comments, updates, etc.), **ALWAYS** include format specification:

**✅ Required for Markdown Content:**
```
format: "markdown"
```

**❌ Common Error - Missing Format:**
- Results in raw markdown rendering instead of formatted display
- Affects professional appearance of work item documentation

**📋 Applies to These MCP Commands:**
- `mcp_ado_wit_add_work_item_comment` 
- Any other ADO commands that accept formatted text content

**🎯 Agent Responsibility:** All agents (Herald, Atlas, Curator, etc.) must include this parameter when creating formatted work item content.

# Integration Test Plan ðŸ§ª

*Validate multi-agent system functionality before production use*

## Pre-Test Setup

1. **Run Agent Setup**: `.\setup-agents.ps1 -Verify`
2. **Restart Claude Code**: Complete restart required after agent installation
3. **Validate Installation**: Run `/agents` â†’ should show 12 agents
4. **Check Health**: Follow `HEALTH-CHECK.md` validation steps

## Test Scenarios (Progressive Complexity)

â†’ Expected: Echo agent activation with quality checklist

"Design a CI/CD pipeline for Business Central"
â†’ Expected: Forge agent activation with technical recommendations
```

**Success Criteria**: 
- Agent-specific terminology and expertise evident
- Domain-appropriate recommendations provided
- No generic/surface-level responses

### Test 2: Multi-Agent Coordination ðŸŽ­
**Objective**: Verify conductor orchestrates complex projects

**Test Command**:

- Project memory template usage

### Test 3: Context Transfer Quality ðŸ”„
**Objective**: Verify context preservation during handoffs

**Test Command**:
```
"Plan a Business Central extension that uses Azure AI services, then create deployment automation and documentation"
```

**Expected Flow**:
1. **Conductor** â†’ **Atlas** (project planning)
2. **Atlas** â†’ **Maven** (BC extension architecture) 
3. **Maven** â†’ **Synth** (AI integration design)
4. **Synth** â†’ **Forge** (deployment automation)
5. **Forge** â†’ **Curator** (documentation structure)

**Success Criteria**:
- Each agent references previous decisions
- Technical constraints preserved across handoffs
- No repeated discovery of requirements
- Consistent terminology and approach

### Test 4: Quality Gate Enforcement âœ…
**Objective**: Verify quality review integration

**Test Command**:
```
"Create publication-ready technical documentation for the Azure AI Business Central integration, ensuring it meets enterprise standards"
```

**Expected Flow**:
1. **Quill** â†’ Content creation
2. **Echo** â†’ Editorial review (quality gate)
3. **Herald** â†’ Publication strategy
4. **Curator** â†’ Knowledge base integration

**Success Criteria**:
- Quality standards clearly defined and applied
- Editorial feedback incorporated before publication
- Professional-grade deliverable quality
- Knowledge capture for future reference

## Error Handling Tests

### Test 5: Agent Fallback Behavior
**Commands to Test**:
```
"Help me with quantum computing in Business Central"
â†’ Expected: Graceful fallback, clear scope limitations

"Generate 50,000 lines of AL code"
â†’ Expected: Scope pushback, practical alternatives suggested
```

### Test 6: Context Overload Management
**Complex Test Command**:
```
"Create a full enterprise solution with AI, blockchain, IoT integration, mobile apps, web portals, API management, security frameworks, monitoring dashboards, automated testing, CI/CD, documentation, training materials, and community outreach plan"
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- **Conductor** breaks into manageable phases
- Clear priority ordering suggested
- Resource constraints acknowledged
- Realistic timeline proposed
